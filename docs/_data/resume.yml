      I worked as an intern at Cyberlogitec and used deep learning to detect gastric/colon cancer from endoscopic images.
      I used 5,800 gastric cancer endoscopic images and 3,000 colon cancer endoscopic images (ENDO, dicom format) as a dataset,
      and used Detection networks such as YOLOv5, DetectoRS, and EfficientDet, and Classification networks such as ResNet and EfficientNet.

    summary: "Recently, there has been active studies on hand gesture recognition to increase immersion and provide user-friendly interaction in a virtual reality environment. However, most studies require specialized sensors or equipment, or show low recognition rates. This paper proposes a hand gesture recognition method using Deep Learning technology without separate sensors or equipment other than camera to recognize static and dynamic hand gestures. First, a series of hand gesture input images are converted into high-frequency images, then each of the hand gestures RGB images and their high-frequency images is learned through the DenseNet three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network. Experimental results on 6 static hand gestures and 9 dynamic hand gestures showed an average of 92.6% recognition rate and increased 4.6% compared to previous DenseNet. The 3D defense game was implemented to verify the results of our study, and an average speed of 30 ms of gesture recognition was found to be available as a real-time user interface for virtual reality applications."

    summary: "가상현실이 의료, 교육, 군사 훈련 등 다방면에서 사용됨에 따라 가상환경에서 자유로운 상호작용을 제공하기 위한 손 제스처 인식에 대한 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다. 그러나 대부분은 별도의 센서를 요구하거나, 낮은 적중률을 보이고 있다. 본 논문은 정적 손 제스처 인식과 동적 손 제스처 인식을 위해 일반적인 USB 카메라 이외의 별도의 센서나 장 비 없이 딥러닝 기술을 사용한 손 제스처 인식 방법을 제안한다. 입력된 손 제스처를 고주파 영상들로 변환한 다음, 각 손 제스처 영상과 고주파 영상에 대해 각각 덴스넷 기반의 이중 흐름 합성곱 신경망을 수행한 다음 융합된 정보로 보다 정확한 손 제스처를 인식한다. 그리고 실시간 인터페이스 검증을 위해 가상현실 기반 3D 디펜스 게임을 개발하 여 실험한 결과, 6개의 정적 손 제스처와 9개의 동적 손 제스처 인터페이스에 대해 기존의 단일 흐름의 덴스넷에 비 해 4.58%의 성능이 향상된 평균 92.6%의 인식률을 보였다. 본 연구의 결과는 마우스나 키보드 없이 다양한 가상현실 응용 분야에서 입력 인터페이스로 활용될 수 있다."

    summary: "With the development of deep learning technology, research is being actively carried out on user-friendly interfaces that are suitable for use in virtual reality or augmented reality applications. To support the interface using the user's hands, this paper proposes a deep learning-based fingertip detection method to enable the tracking of fingertip coordinates to select virtual objects, or to write or draw in the air. After cutting the approximate part of the corresponding fingertip object from the input image with the Grad-CAM, and perform the convolution neural network with Atrous Convolution for the cut image to detect fingertip location. This method is simpler and easier to implement than existing object detection algorithms without requiring a pre-processing for annotating objects. To verify this method we implemented an air writing application and showed that the recognition rate of 81% and the speed of 76 ms were able to write smoothly without delay in the air, making it possible to utilize the application in real time."

    summary: "Recently, research is being actively carried out to provide a user-friendly interface in virtual reality and augmented reality applications by applying rapidly developed deep learning technology. This paper proposes a deep learning-based fingertip detection method that detects real-time fingertips in order to provide the interface using the user’s hand. This method introduces the DenseNet Connectivity to the VGG-19 network without the required annotation preprocessing process in the existing object detection network, reducing the total number of parameters and the time required, and detecting the fingertips using the Atrous Convolution and the Grad-CAM. As a result of experimenting with this method in various environments, it was found that real-time processing of 34.4 ms is possible with an average recognition rate of 5% higher than the existing method (SSD network). As a result of this study, the application for real-time air-writing using the user's fingertips was developed, showing the usability of the user interface."
